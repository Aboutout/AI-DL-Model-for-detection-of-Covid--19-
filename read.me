➢ We are developing the Deep Learning model which can classify the X-ray images as Carona positive or negative with more
than 90% of accuracy.
➢ We are analyzing the daily CSSEGISandData data based on confirmed positive cases, number of deaths, and number of
recoveries. We are developing a robust predicting model that can predict future cases.
